        "\n",
        "1. **Store-level Insights :**  \n",
        "   - A handful of stores (e.g., **Store 226, 88, and 165**) generate the majority of sales.  \n",
        "   - This indicates that **store size, location, and customer base** play a significant role in driving revenue.  \n",
        "   - These top-performing stores can be leveraged for **piloting new campaigns, product launches, or targeted promotions**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Brand-level Insights :**  \n",
        "   - **Kettle** is the dominant brand, consistently leading both overall and store-specific sales.  \n",
        "   - Other strong performers include **Doritos, Pringles, and Smiths**, while smaller brands contribute marginally.  \n",
        "   - This shows that **brand loyalty** and **consumer preference** are concentrated in a few key brands.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Product & Pack Size Preferences :**  \n",
        "   - **175g packs** are the most preferred, far ahead of other sizes.  \n",
        "   - Mid-sized packs (150g‚Äì175g) dominate the sales landscape, while larger packs perform poorly.  \n",
        "   - Customers prefer **convenient, moderately priced pack sizes**, suggesting impulse-driven or household-oriented consumption.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Customer Demographics :**  \n",
        "   - **Older Families, Retirees, and Young Singles/Couples** are the largest contributors to sales.  \n",
        "   - **Budget and Mainstream customers** dominate across most life stages, while Premium customers contribute selectively.  \n",
        "   - Demographics strongly influence **what customers buy and how much they spend**, but average product quantity per basket remains stable across groups.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Basket Analysis :**  \n",
        "   - The majority of baskets contain only **1‚Äì2 items**, with an average spend of **$5‚Äì$10 per transaction**.  \n",
        "   - This highlights the **snack/convenience nature** of purchases rather than bulk buying.  \n",
        "   - Upselling strategies (e.g., **‚ÄúBuy 2, Get 1 Free‚Äù**) could effectively increase basket size.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Temporal Sales Trends :**  \n",
        "   - Sales remain stable overall, but **seasonality effects** are evident:  \n",
        "     - Peaks in **December (holiday season)** and **March (quarterly rebound)**.  \n",
        "     - A slump in **February**, likely due to the short month and post-holiday slowdown.  \n",
        "   - Week-over-week analysis shows a strong **front-loading of sales in Weeks 1‚Äì4**, with sharp declines in **Week 5**.  \n",
        "   - These cyclical patterns can help businesses **time promotions and manage inventory more effectively**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Correlation Analysis :**  \n",
        "   - **Selling price has the strongest influence on total sales (correlation = 0.84)**, compared to product quantity.  \n",
        "   - Price and quantity are largely independent, suggesting demand is relatively **price inelastic**.  \n",
        "   - This provides businesses with flexibility in **pricing strategies** without drastically impacting volume.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Targeted Promotions & Campaigns :**  \n",
        "   - Leverage high-performing stores (e.g., Store 226, 88) for **new product launches and pilot campaigns**.  \n",
        "   - Use **multi-buy promotions** to encourage larger basket sizes.  \n",
        "   - Seasonal campaigns in **December** and **March** can maximize demand, while **February dips** can be mitigated with discounts or loyalty offers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inventory & Assortment Planning :**  \n",
        "   - Prioritize stocking of **top-performing pack sizes (175g, 150g, 134g)**.  \n",
        "   - Re-evaluate underperforming large pack sizes; consider repositioning, bundling, or SKU rationalization.  \n",
        "   - Ensure consistent availability of top brands like **Kettle, Doritos, and Pringles** across all stores.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Customer Segmentation Strategy :**  \n",
        "   - Focus on **Older Families, Retirees, and Young Singles/Couples** as primary target groups.  \n",
        "   - Develop differentiated promotions for **Budget vs. Premium customers**, since both contribute significantly but exhibit different buying behaviors.  \n",
        "   - Explore **untapped potential in New Families and Midage groups** with specialized marketing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pricing Strategy :**  \n",
        "   - Since demand is **price inelastic**, experiment with **premium pricing** for high-demand products.  \n",
        "   - Introduce **bundle discounts** to increase quantity purchased per transaction.  \n",
        "   - Monitor price sensitivity across different demographics to refine targeted offers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Future Analytical Enhancements :**  \n",
        "   - Perform **time series forecasting** (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.) for predicting sales trends and planning inventory.  \n",
        "   - Apply **market basket analysis (association rules)** to discover product affinities and cross-sell opportunities.  \n",
        "   - Conduct **customer segmentation (clustering models)** to refine targeting beyond life stage and premium classification.  \n",
        "   - Use **predictive models** (e.g., regression, XGBoost) to evaluate the impact of price, promotions, and demographics on sales."
